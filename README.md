# Welcome to my GitHub Pages site
At the moment I am working on a whole lot of things. The following are some of the few:

* [Simple Swarm job creator in python](http://git.diamuggles.com/simple-python-swarm)
* [An easy and quick Python tutorial for Neuroscientists](http://sanket-git.diamuggles.com/Python-for-Neuroscientists/)
* [A Download-Upload GUI for XNAT hosted data](http://sanket-git.diamuggles.com/guptesanket/XnatDUI)

and I think there is more.
